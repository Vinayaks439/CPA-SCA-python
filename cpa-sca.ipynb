    "The `traces_AES.csv` file contains three columns: **Plaintext**, **Ciphertext**, and **Traces**. This file represents actual power trace data collected from a power analysis experiment conducted on a chip. Each row corresponds to power trace measurements for 10 rounds of AES encryption associated with a specific plaintext-ciphertext pair."
