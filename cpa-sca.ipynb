    "Daniel is a security engineer, and he has a got a project for side-channel analysis of\n",

    "The `traces_AES.csv` file contains three columns: **Plaintext**, **Ciphertext**, and **Traces**.

    "\n",
    "Like in the DoM based DPA attack, the Correlation Power Attack (CPA) also relies on targeting an intermediate computation, typically the input or output of an S-Box. These intermediate values are as seen previously computed from a known value, typically the ciphertext and a portion of the key, which is guessed. The power model is subsequently used to develop a hypothetical power trace of the device for a given input to the cipher. This hypothetical power values are then stored in a matrix for several inputs and can be indexed by the known value of the ciphertext or the guessed key byte. This matrix is denoted as H, the hypothetical power matrix. Along with this, the attacker also observes the actual power traces, and stores them in a matrix for several inputs. The actual power values can be indexed by the known value of the ciphertext and the time instance when the power value was observed. This matrix is denoted as T, the real power matrix. It may be observed that one of the columns of the matrix H corresponds to the actual key, denoted as kc. In order to distinguish the key from the others, the attacker looks for similarity between the columns of the matrix H and those of the matrix T. The similarity is typically computed\n",
